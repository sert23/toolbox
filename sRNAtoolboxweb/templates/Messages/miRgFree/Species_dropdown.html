<p> You can choose one or several evolutionary close species (from miRGeneDB) to be used in the annotation of miRNA predictions.
    Please note that this information will only be used after the prediction has taken place,
    so it will not affect the outcome of the prediction in any way. </p>
{#<p> <strong class="text-danger"> If no species are selected, either miRBase short names (see microRNA section) or 'user libraries' need to be provided </strong> </p>#}
